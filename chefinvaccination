   There were NN students (numbered 11 through NN) participating in the Indian Programming Camp (IPC) and they watched a total of KK lectures
   (numbered 11 through KK). For each student ii and each lecture jj, the ii-th student watched the jj-th lecture for T_{i, j}T i,j​  minutes.

Additionally, for each student ii, we know that this student asked the question, "What is the criteria for getting a certificate?" Q_iQ i​  times.

The criteria for getting a certificate is that a student must have watched at least MM minutes 
of lectures in total and they must have asked the questionno more than 1010 times.

Find out how many participants are eligible for a certificate.
